Introduction
============

This document serves as a design documentation to create a Cartesian trajectory definition for ROS.
As there have been many proposals in the past, but there is no standardized interface, this
document tries to incorporate as many suggestions as possible to derive a common definition useful
to as many people as possible.

Target of this project
----------------------
This is part of a larger project that tries to achieve Cartesian trajectory execution on Universal
Robots robotic arms. Expected outcome of this project is to provide a Cartesian equivalent of the
`control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectory.action
<http://docs.ros.org/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html>`_.

Contribution
------------
TODO: Write a better text for this section. The text below is only to get the point of this
section...

This document is meant to be a community effort. We would like to generate an interface suitable for
as many people, as possible. Therefore, any input is welcome. This project is hosted at <TODO: HOST
THIS SOMEWHERE>. Please get in touch with us and enter the discussion.
